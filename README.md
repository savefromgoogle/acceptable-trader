# Acceptable Trader
Acceptable Trader is a tool for managing and participating in [board game math trades](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Math_Trades), a specific type of trade in which the maximum number of possible trades are calculated using an algorithm, such as [TradeMaximizer](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/TradeMaximizer).

Acceptable Trader aims to provide a clean, intuitive interface such that the high barrier to entry inheret to math trades might be a bit lower. In addition, Acceptable Trader tries to be unreliant on BoardGameGeek for anything outside of item data and user verification.

Acceptable Trader is built on Ruby on Rails and React.js.
